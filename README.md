# facebook.com_Clone
So, this repository belongs my first project in Tailwind CSS which is a clone webpage of 'Facebook.com'.
Here I use all the Tailwind css Utility class using the 'style.css' and link it with the html file and some other set-ups also done to acess all the Tailwind css class
Though it is not the exact but, I try my best to do it. In Tailwind Css i can't find  Strong lime green colour for the create new account button so i use the @apply directry of Tailwind CSS and add the  Strong lime green(#42b72a) using basic way of CSS.
